Since I really wanted to learn the fundamentals of Python, I asked a teacher whether it would be possible to organize a Python elective. Luckily, it was easily arranged! In 10 weeks I have gotten classes in the fundamentals of Python, got some assignment to practise those and worked on the end assignment.

The end assignment consisted of writing an object-oriented Python programme for a self-chosen game. Some of the requirements were:
- Create a game (thus make it interactive with user), for this you can use keyboard input
- Use the Pyglet library (sprites etc)
- Work object-oriented and use polymorphism with inheritance
- Make the game real-time (thus independent of processor speed)
- Ofcourse write clean code

For my game I decided to create Space Invaders and because of this I worked on the following:
- How to efficiëntly create game-objects (like, if all objects need to have certain characteristics, what is the best way to make that more efficiënt)
- Make sure the data structures were correct (needed to delete objects, otherwise they would still exist in the memory)
- How to correctly use imported libraries and how to not make the programme to dependent on it (is relatively easily switched with another library)
- (Next level) debugging

Some things I'd prefer to have done better:
- If I would have had time I would have wanted to add:
    - more types of enemies
    - an actual real-time game (I didn't get the chance to not make it dependent on the given frame-rate, which may differ if computer is given more load)
    - more documenting/commenting 
    - some of the attributes of the game could have used a separate class, so I would have found it more organised if I created those (tried to start that with the start_screen and gameover_screen)
    
    
All in all I really think it was a great assignment for me. I loved being able to code again (I didn't have any programming classes that block) and dive into a new language. In the beginning it was difficult to find my way in the new syntax, but after some practise it became second nature. I really believe I have learnt the fundamentals of Python (and Pyglet) and it will be easier to start other projects with this language now as well. 
Besides the experience with Python, this elective has given me the opportunity to implement the knowledge gained in the first year of my study. Object-oriented programming and data structures were taught last year, but I hadn't had the opportunity to really put that knowledge into practise yet, besides in the assignments for those classes.
